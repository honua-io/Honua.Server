# HonuaIO - Source-Available Project

Thank you for your interest in HonuaIO! This document clarifies the contribution model and licensing for this project.

## Project Status: Source-Available, Not Open Source

HonuaIO is licensed under the **Elastic License 2.0 (ELv2)**, which means:

- ✅ The source code is **publicly available** for inspection and evaluation
- ✅ You can **use, modify, and deploy** HonuaIO for your own purposes
- ✅ You can **build applications** on top of HonuaIO
- ❌ You **cannot offer HonuaIO as a hosted service** to third parties
- ❌ This is **not an open source license** (not OSI-approved)

## Contribution Policy

**HonuaIO is not currently accepting community contributions.**

This project is maintained by the HonuaIO team, and we are not accepting pull requests, feature contributions, or code changes from the community at this time. This decision allows us to:

- Maintain a clear product vision and roadmap
- Control the quality and direction of the codebase
- Avoid legal complexity around contributor agreements
- Focus resources on core development rather than PR review

## How You Can Help

While we're not accepting code contributions, there are other ways you can support HonuaIO:

### 1. Report Issues

If you encounter bugs or problems, please **report them**:

1. Check if the issue already exists in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/honua/honua.next/issues)
2. If not, create a new issue with:
   - Clear description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Environment details (OS, .NET version, database, etc.)
   - Relevant logs or error messages

**Note**: Issue reports do not guarantee fixes will be implemented, but they help us understand how the software is being used.

### 2. Share Feedback

Your usage feedback is valuable:

- Share your use cases and deployment scenarios
- Suggest features or improvements (as discussions, not PRs)
- Report performance observations
- Document workarounds for common problems

### 3. Documentation Improvements

## Security Vulnerabilities

For security issues, please see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for our responsible disclosure policy.

**Do not report security vulnerabilities in public issues.**

## Code of Conduct

Even though we're not accepting code contributions, we expect respectful and professional behavior in all interactions:

- Be respectful and constructive in issues and discussions
- Avoid demanding features or fixes
- Understand that issue reports may not result in immediate action
- Respect the maintainers' time and decisions

## Why This Model?

You might wonder why we've chosen this approach rather than a traditional open source model:

1. **Product Focus**: We want to maintain a clear vision and avoid feature creep
2. **Quality Control**: Maintaining consistency in code quality and architecture
3. **Resource Allocation**: Small team focused on development, not PR review
4. **Commercial Viability**: Supporting a sustainable business model
5. **Legal Simplicity**: Avoiding CLA complexity and contributor agreements

This model is used successfully by other projects like Elasticsearch, Kibana, and MongoDB.
