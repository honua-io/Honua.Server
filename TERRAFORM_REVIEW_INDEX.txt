2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
   File: /home/mike/projects/HonuaIO/TERRAFORM_REVIEW_SUMMARY.txt
   Size: 9KB
   Contents:
   - Critical Findings (high-level)
   - What's Working in Terraform
   - Critical Gaps
   - Implementation Roadmap
   - Key Architectural Insights
   - Business Impact
   - Next Steps
   
   AUDIENCE: Managers, team leads, decision makers
   USE: Quick understanding of issues and priorities

3. DEPLOYMENT MATRIX
   File: /home/mike/projects/HonuaIO/TERRAFORM_DEPLOYMENT_MATRIX.md
   Size: 12KB
   Contents:
   - Deployment Options Matrix (table view)
   - Feature Coverage by Cloud Provider
   - Project Structure Coverage
   - Infrastructure Components Coverage
   - Implementation Priorities & Effort
   - Current Terraform File Statistics
   - Quick Decision Matrix
   
   AUDIENCE: Operations teams, cloud architects
   USE: Quick reference for what's supported where

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS - AT A GLANCE:
================================================================================

TERRAFORM COVERAGE: ~30%
- Infrastructure foundation: EXCELLENT (multi-region, multi-cloud)
- Application deployment: MISSING (70% of deployment options)

CRITICAL GAPS:
1. Serverless (Cloud Run, Lambda, Container Apps) - P1 BLOCKING
2. Lite variant in Kubernetes - P2 HIGH VALUE
3. Container registries (all clouds) - P2 NEEDED
4. GCP regional stack - P2 PARITY
5. Other services (Intake, Gateway, etc.) - P3 MEDIUM

ESTIMATED EFFORT:
- P1 (Serverless): 1 week
- P2 (Lite, Registries, GCP): 1 week
- P3 (Services, Docker, Dashboard): 1.5 weeks
TOTAL: 4-6 weeks with 2-3 person team

IMPACT:
- Without fixes: Users must manually provision infrastructure
- With fixes: Complete IaC coverage across all deployment options

================================================================================
HOW TO USE THESE DOCUMENTS:
================================================================================

STEP 1: Read the Executive Summary (5 minutes)
   /home/mike/projects/HonuaIO/TERRAFORM_REVIEW_SUMMARY.txt
   
STEP 2: Reference the Deployment Matrix
   /home/mike/projects/HonuaIO/TERRAFORM_DEPLOYMENT_MATRIX.md
   (For what's missing in your specific cloud/use case)

STEP 3: Review the Detailed Technical Report
   /home/mike/projects/HonuaIO/docs/TERRAFORM_REVIEW_2025-11-01.md
   (For implementation details and code examples)

STEP 4: Create implementation plan using:
   - Priority Matrix (in technical report)
   - Code examples (in technical report, Part 5)
   - File organization recommendations (in technical report, Part 6)

================================================================================
QUICK LINKS TO SPECIFIC SECTIONS:
================================================================================

For Executives/Managers:
- Read: TERRAFORM_REVIEW_SUMMARY.txt
- Key section: "Business Impact" and "Implementation Roadmap"
- Decision needed: Serverless support priority

For Technical Teams:
- Read: docs/TERRAFORM_REVIEW_2025-11-01.md
- Key sections: Part 5 (Recommendations) with code examples
- Start: PRIORITY 1 (serverless modules) for highest ROI

For Cloud Architects:
- Read: TERRAFORM_DEPLOYMENT_MATRIX.md
- Key sections: Cloud-specific coverage tables
- Reference: Quick Decision Matrix

For Operations:
- Read: TERRAFORM_DEPLOYMENT_MATRIX.md
- Key sections: Implementation Priorities & Effort
- Reference: Current Terraform File Statistics

================================================================================
NEXT ACTIONS:
================================================================================

1. Review executive summary (TERRAFORM_REVIEW_SUMMARY.txt)
2. Share with team leads and architects
3. Discuss priorities: Is serverless support needed? (P1)
4. Allocate DevOps team (2-3 engineers)
5. Start implementation with P1 (serverless)
6. Use detailed report (TERRAFORM_REVIEW_2025-11-01.md) as guide
7. Follow code examples in Part 5 for implementation

================================================================================
QUESTIONS ANSWERED IN THESE DOCUMENTS:
================================================================================

"What's currently provisioned by Terraform?"
→ See Part 1 of detailed report or Executive Summary

"What deployment options exist but aren't provisioned?"
→ See Part 3 (Gap Analysis) of detailed report

"How much effort to fix this?"
→ See Implementation Priority Matrix in all documents

"What should we prioritize?"
→ All documents recommend P1: Serverless deployments (1 week)

"Do we need to rewrite everything?"
→ No. Terraform foundation is solid. Add serverless support.

"How does this compare to competitor products?"
→ AWS/Azure have strong support. GCP needs attention.

"What code examples can we use?"
→ Part 5 of detailed report has working code snippets.
