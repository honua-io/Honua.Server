# GitHub Dependency Review Workflow
#
# Purpose: Block pull requests with vulnerable dependencies
#
# This workflow:
# - Scans all dependency changes in PRs against CVE databases
# - Fails PR checks if critical vulnerabilities are introduced
# - Comments on PRs with vulnerability details and remediation guidance
# - Prevents vulnerable code from being merged
#
# Documentation: .github/SECURITY_SCANNING.md
#
# Triggers: Pull requests (automatic, no configuration needed)
