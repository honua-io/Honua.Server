# Default Deny All Traffic
# This NetworkPolicy implements a zero-trust security model by denying all ingress and egress traffic by default.
# Specific traffic must be explicitly allowed by other NetworkPolicies.
#
# Security rationale:
# - Prevents lateral movement between pods
# - Requires explicit allow rules for all communication
# - Follows principle of least privilege
# - Protects against compromised pods
